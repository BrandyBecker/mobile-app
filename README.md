# Connect Our Kids - Mobile App

## Mission

> Our mission is to empower social workers with free modern technology to find permanent loving homes for foster kids.

Social workers who are not familiar with Connect Our Kids will learn about us through their personal connections, social media, emails, and training programs.
Social workers can learn more at [connectourkids.org](https://connectourkids.org), where they will be able to follow "download mobile app" to their device's app store to install this app.

Once they have downloaded the app, social workers will have basic access to the app's features.
Users will be prompted to log in or sign up to obtain full access.
Once authenticated, users will have full access to the app's features (including People Search).

In the future, we want authenticated users to have access to the full features of Family Connections and Best Practices while using the mobile app.
